# ETME-coral-reef-dissertation
This repository contains the primary R scripts and cleaned datasets used for the diversity and functional group analyses presented in my 3rd year dissertation project on coral reef ecosystems across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.

Scripts: Data cleaning, subsampling, and main analyses were conducted in RStudio.

Data: Cleaned coral reef fossil occurrence data extracted from the Paleobiology Database (PBDB), along with regional datasets.

Final figures were developed externally in other software (e.g., Excel/PowerPoint) after exporting data and basic plots from R. Functional group classifications were manually assigned in Excel.
